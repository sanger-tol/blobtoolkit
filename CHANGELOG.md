### Enhancements & fixes

Initial release of sanger-tol/blobtoolkit :tada:

- Required input: (1) Tree of Life organism ID (ToLID, --input) or (2) FASTA genome file (--fasta) and `samplesheet.csv` (--input) containing paths to aligned reads in CRAM format, see description of _Full samplesheet_ in `docs/usage.md`.
- Lineages to run BUSCO are obtained using the [Genomes on a Tree (GoaT) API](https://goat.genomehubs.org/api) from the `--taxon` parameter (NCBI taxonomy ID or species binomial name) or a list of taxa in a `--taxa_file`, instead of reading them from `config.yaml` file.
- Versions of tools are collected into `TBC/versions.yml` instead of `<blob_dir>/config.yaml` file, using the [custom_dumpsoftwareversions nf-core module](https://nf-co.re/modules/custom_dumpsoftwareversions). Software versions in `<blob_dir>/config.yaml` do *not* reflect the actual versions used in the pipeline.
- The pipeline requires aligned reads, `minimap2` is no longer included.
- A GCA accession ID or YAML file is required (--accession or --yaml) to allow compatibility with `blobtoolkit` scripts. These are used to either generate or read a `config.yaml` file but do not pass parameters to the pipeline. Also software versions in this file do not reflect the actual versions used in the pipeline. 
- [fastawindows module](https://nf-co.re/modules/fastawindows) computes statistics across windows over the genome FASTA file.
- Parameters for [diamond_blastp module](https://nf-co.re/modules/diamond_blastp) should be specified in `nextflow.config` file.

This release marks the point where the pipeline was moved from Snakemake at [blobtoolkit/blobtoolkit](https://github.com/blobtoolkit/blobtoolkit) over to Nextflow DSL2 at [sanger-tol/blobtoolkit](https://github.com/sanger-tol/blobtoolkit). There are two subworkflows in the Snakemake version that are still being implemented in Nextflow: `diamond_blastx` and `blastn`.

### Parameters

| Old parameter | New parameter   |
| ------------- | --------------- |
|               | --accession     |
|               | --blastp_outext |
|               | --blastp_cols   |
|               | --fasta         |
|               | --input         |
|               | --taxon         |
|               | --yaml          |

> **NB:** Parameter has been **updated** if both old and new parameter information is present. </br> **NB:** Parameter has been **added** if just the new parameter information
> is present. </br> **NB:** Parameter has been **removed** if new parameter information isn't present.

### Software dependencies

Note, since the pipeline is using Nextflow DSL2, each process will be run with its own [Biocontainer](https://biocontainers.pro/#/registry). This means that on occasion it is e
ntirely possible for the pipeline to be using different versions of the same tool. However, the overall software dependency changes compared to the last release have been liste
d below for reference. Only `Docker` or `Singularity` containers are supported, `conda` is not supported.

| Dependency             | Old version | New version |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| blastn                 | 2.12.0      |             |
| blobtools              | 4.0.7       | 4.1.2       |
| busco                  | 5.3.2       | 5.4.3       |
| fasta_windows          |             | 0.2.4       |
| gunzip                 |             | 1.10        |
| minimap2               | 2.24-r1122  |             |
| multiqc                |             | 1.13        |
| seqtk                  | 1.3-r106    |             |
| windowmasker (blast\*) | 2.12.0      |             |

> **NB:** Dependency has been **updated** if both old and new version information is present. </br> **NB:** Dependency has been **added** if just the new version information is
> present. </br> **NB:** Dependency has been **removed** if version information isn't present.

- blastn sub-workflow will be included in the next release.
- blast\* version that runs windowmasker is specified, windowmasker is no longer used in this version.
