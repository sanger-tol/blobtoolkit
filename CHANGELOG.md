### Enhancements & fixes

Initial release of sanger-tol/blobtoolkit :tada

This release marks the point where the pipeline was moved from Snakemake at [blobtoolkit/blobtoolkit](https://github.com/blobtoolkit/blobtoolkit) over to Nextflow DSL2 at [sanger-tol/blobtoolkit](https://github.com/sanger-tol/blobtoolkit).

### Parameters

| Old parameter | New parameter |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|               |               |
|               |               |
|               |               |

> **NB:** Parameter has been **updated** if both old and new parameter information is present. </br> **NB:** Parameter has been **added** if just the new parameter information
> is present. </br> **NB:** Parameter has been **removed** if new parameter information isn't present.

### Software dependencies

Note, since the pipeline is using Nextflow DSL2, each process will be run with its own [Biocontainer](https://biocontainers.pro/#/registry). This means that on occasion it is e
ntirely possible for the pipeline to be using different versions of the same tool. However, the overall software dependency changes compared to the last release have been liste
d below for reference.

| Dependency | Old version | New version |
| ---------- | ----------- | ----------- |
|            |             |             |
|            |             |             |
|            |             |             |
|            |             |             |
